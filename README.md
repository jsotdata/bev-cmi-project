Version 2.1

## Introduction

This is a MATLAB&reg; Project containing
a [Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) model](BEV/README.md) and
its components such as
motor, high voltage battery, and longitudinal vehicle.
This project demonstrates Simscape's modular and
multi-fidelity modeling technology.

The abstract BEV model is built in a simple and modular fashion,
and it can run faster than real-time.
It is suitable as a baseline model for drive cycle simulation
to estimate vehicle's electrical efficiency and
other vehicle-level information.

This project also contains the model of a detailed
permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) and controller.
It captures the detailed behaviors of the AC motor drive unit
and can estimate the electrical efficiency at the unit level.

A Live Script demonstrates how to obtain the electrical efficiency
from the slow but detailed motor drive unit and use the result
as the block parameter of the simple but fast motor drive block
in the BEV model.

## What's New in 2.1 (March, 2023)

- The project has been updated to MATLAB R2023a.
- A shortcut button to open **MATLAB Test Manager**
  is added in the Project Shortcuts tab of the toolstrip.
  MATLAB Test Manager requires the **MATLAB Test** license.

See [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) for more details.

## What's New in 2.0 (February, 2023)

- BEV system model uses updated components and
  has simpler and easier configurability
  for selecting vehicle speed reference input.
- High voltage battery component provides
  four different models:
  **Basic**, **System simple**, **System**, and **System tabulated**.
  They are all system level models and abstract,
  but they prodive different fidelity levels of the model.
  See [README](./Components/BatteryHighVoltage/README.md) in
  **Components > BatteryHighVoltage** for more details.
- Motor drive unit component provides
  four different models:
  **Basic**, **Basic thermal**, **System**, and **System tabulated**.
  They are all system level models and abstract,
  but they prodive different fidelity levels of the model.
  See [README](./Components/MotorDriveUnit/README.md) in
  **Components > MotorDriveUnit** for more details.
- A detailed battery model built with a custom Simscape library
  has been removed.
  [This project][url-bev] will remain focused
  on vehicle system-level applications using abstract models
  in future updates.
  A new project [Electric Vehicle Design with Simscape][url-bev-design]
  serves as an alternative for detailed model applications.

See [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) for more details.

## How to Use

Open `BatteryElectricVehicle.prj` in MATLAB, and
it will automatically open the Live Script `BEV_main_script.mlx`.
The script contains the description of the model and
hyperlinks to models and scripts.

## How to Use in MATLAB Online
