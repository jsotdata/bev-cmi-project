## Project Overview

Welcome to the Battery Electric Vehicle Simulation project, an extension of Isaac Ito's original work at MathWorks on the [Battery Electric Vehicle Simulink model](https://github.com/mathworks/Simscape-Battery-Electric-Vehicle-Model) which was nodified under the CMI-Rogers initiative. Our goal in this project was to build upon the foundation laid by Isaac Ito so that we could tailor it to our specific requirements.

## Objectives

Incorporating modifications that align with our project goals, we identified three key objectives:

1. **Persistent battery state.** One of our priorities was to retain the battery status between simulation runs, allowing for a seamless continuation of testing and analysis.
2. **Battery aging simulation.** We aimed to enhance the realism of the simulation by implementing battery aging over time with regular use, providing insights into the long-term behavior of electric vehicle batteries.
3. **Dynamic battery charging.** To mimic real-world scenarios, we introduced a mechanism for the battery to recharge when depleted, further enriching the simulation's accuracy.

## Implementation Highlights

To achieve these objectives, we made substantial adjustments to two primary subcomponents of the original model:

- **Controller & Environment**. Within this subcomponent, we redefined the driving profile to transition to a stationary state when the battery's charge is depleted, reflecting a more accurate representation of a depleted battery's impact on driving conditions.

- **System Battery.** Here, we implemented a constant charging block that supplies a consistent current to the battery while it powers the vehicle. This modification enables us to model the battery charging process during operation realistically.

This repository is a testament to our collaborative efforts in extending Isaac Ito's foundational work to create a versatile and practical Battery Electric Vehicle Simulation. We hope that our modifications and enhancements prove valuable to the electric vehicle research and simulation community.

## Model Documentation

### Introduction

This is a MATLAB&reg; Project containing
a [Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) model](BEV/README.md) and
its components such as
motor, high voltage battery, and longitudinal vehicle.
This project demonstrates Simscape's modular and
multi-fidelity modeling technology.

The abstract BEV model is built in a simple and modular fashion,
and it can run faster than real-time.
It is suitable as a baseline model for drive cycle simulation
to estimate vehicle's electrical efficiency and
other vehicle-level information.

This project also contains the model of a detailed
permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) and controller.
It captures the detailed behaviors of the AC motor drive unit
and can estimate the electrical efficiency at the unit level.

A Live Script demonstrates how to obtain the electrical efficiency
from the slow but detailed motor drive unit and use the result
as the block parameter of the simple but fast motor drive block
in the BEV model.

### What's New in 2.1 (March, 2023)

- The project has been updated to MATLAB R2023a.
- A shortcut button to open **MATLAB Test Manager**
  is added in the Project Shortcuts tab of the toolstrip.
  MATLAB Test Manager requires the **MATLAB Test** license.

See [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) for more details.

### What's New in 2.0 (February, 2023)

- BEV system model uses updated components and
  has simpler and easier configurability
  for selecting vehicle speed reference input.
- High voltage battery component provides
  four different models:
  **Basic**, **System simple**, **System**, and **System tabulated**.
  They are all system level models and abstract,
  but they prodive different fidelity levels of the model.
  See [README](./Components/BatteryHighVoltage/README.md) in
  **Components > BatteryHighVoltage** for more details.
- Motor drive unit component provides
  four different models:
  **Basic**, **Basic thermal**, **System**, and **System tabulated**.
  They are all system level models and abstract,
  but they prodive different fidelity levels of the model.
  See [README](./Components/MotorDriveUnit/README.md) in
  **Components > MotorDriveUnit** for more details.
- A detailed battery model built with a custom Simscape library
  has been removed.
  [This project][url-bev] will remain focused
  on vehicle system-level applications using abstract models
  in future updates.
  A new project [Electric Vehicle Design with Simscape][url-bev-design]
  serves as an alternative for detailed model applications.

See [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) for more details.
