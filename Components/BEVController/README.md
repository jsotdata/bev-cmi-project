# BEV Controller Component

This is a BEV controller component for
BEV system level simulation.
It is currently just a simple speed tracking controller.
More control features will be added in future updates.

The harness model (`BEVController_harness_model`)
in the `Harness` folder is used for elementary tests
just to check that the controller component loads and runs.
For more tests, the BEV system model is better suited.
