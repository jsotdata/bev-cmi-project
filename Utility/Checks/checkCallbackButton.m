function checkCallbackButton(targetModel, fileList)
%% Checks ClickFcn callback of Callback Button block
% This function finds Callback Button blocks from the target model (1st argument)
% and checks the content of its ClickFcn callback.
% If ClickFcn contains the `edit` command, check is made such that
% filename passed to it exists in the file list (2nd argument).
% If ClickFcn does not contain `edit`, ClickFcn is evaluated.
%
% There is a strong assumption that ClickFcn is extremely simple and short,
% especially when `edit` is used.
%
% Not evaluating `edit` is important because `edit` always errors
% if MATLAB is launched with -nodesktop option,
% which is the case in Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline,
% meaning that CI fails once `edit` is evaluated.
% Because of this reason, tests during CI never use `edit`.
% However, `edit` is used in some of the callbacks,
% and it is important to make sure that it works in interactive uses.
%
% Callback Button blocks within referenced subsystems included in
% the target model are not checked.
% To check those blocks, pass the referenced subsystem directly to this function.
